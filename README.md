# Aora Application
### Explore my new application developped by React Native and using appwrite as a backend plateform

To run the application, first clone the repo locally.

Then run the command : npm install

Them run the command :  npx expo start -c

After you have to install the expo Go in your device, then scan the code bar if you have an iOS or copy the link you got in the expo go app.

Finally enjoy!
